* API Party  

A survey on how to create an API using different libraries  

The objective is to show that Ruby has a rich ecosystem for building servers  
Pick one that you like  

Would be covering Grape and Webmachine for REST APIs and Celluloid for RPC APIs  

Grape is like Sinatra but focussed on creating a REST API  

Webmachine is a port of an Erlang library which treats the HTTP request-respose cycle   
as a state machine  

Celluloid is a framework for building multithreaded programs  
Will be using it to build a RPC server  

am using http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow as an example  

Other choices: 
1. faye with goliath  
2. active_record_serializers and rails_api  
3. vertx  
4. Mongrel2
